# How Has COVID-19 Affected Citi Bike Rentals in New York?


### Has the proportions of short-term and annual subscribers changed?
This visualization displays popular hours throughout the day in summer and winter of 2020 and 2021 based on membership status.

Comparing the summers of 2020 and 2021 there has been an increase of at least 28% in the number of riders. Winters of 2020 and 2021 number of riders also increased by at least 45%.

Popular times during the summer are between 4pm and 7pm. Popular times during the winter are between 1pm and 5pm.

In conclusion, COVID- 19 seems to have little to no negative effect in either the number of riders who rented Citi Bikes or its membership status. Due to New York being locked down in December 2020, the bell curve for all visuals remain nearly identical except with 2021 visuals having a rise in the number of riders. 


### What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
These charts are a comparison between the average trip duration during the summers of 2020 and 2021. The peak hours for summer are between 5pm and 6pm.

There are nearly 75% more annual subscribers than there are customers who have short term passes.
The average trip duration for customers are 20hrs, while the average trip for subscribers are 8hrs. Riders who have annual subscriptions are more likely to be locals since the average usage could correlate with an average commute for an 8 hour workday. 

Comparing the customers category in July 2020 and 2021, the average trip duration decreases. The average in 2020 lies around 20 hours, while the average in 2021 is roughly 15 hours. This phenomenon could be the result of not enough Citi Bike Stations, therefore riders end up renting the bike for longer. An increase to the number of stations could correlate with shorter average trip durations. 


### What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?
With the rise of COVID-19 cases during winter of 2020, New York was forced to lockdown which resulted in less tourisms and more locals forced to stay home or work from home. 

Towards the end of the year in 2021, COVID-19 restrictions and ban were mostly lifted which resulted in a growth of riders who are annual subscribers. Another trend that could correlate with the number of riders in 2021 could be the result of more stations available outside of the main city. 

The peak hours for winters of 2020 and 2021 are between 3pm and 5pm. The shift in peak hours compared to summer time could be affected by the weather. The average trip duration for subscribers is 7 hours while the average for short-term users are 14 hours. 


### What trend can be found in each station's popularity over time? 
In these visualizations, the stations that are marked are the most popular start and end stations consistent trhoughout the years. 

From July 2020 to December 2021, there is a surge in the number of stations throughout New York. Especially in the northern and south eastern part of New York. 

As the markers turn more red, the number of riders per station rises.  Due to New York being a popular city for tourism, stations more inland have greater popularity compared to the rest of the stations outside of the city. A reoccuring trend is popular tourist areas such as 'West St & Chambers St', 'W21 St & 6 Ave', and 'E17 St & Broadway' are the consistently the most popular stations.
